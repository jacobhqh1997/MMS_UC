## Overview
Urothelial carcinoma (UC), encompassing lower and upper tract variants, remains a prevalent and lethal malignancy within the urinary tract. Precise  UC survival risk stratification is critical for accurate personalized therapy. Here we present an interactive, interpretable and  integrated deep learning system for biomarker exploration and prognosis prediction. Inspired by the previous research "PathFinder" and "MCAT", six potential BCa prognostic biomarkers were explored and evaluated.

## Pre-requisites and Environment

### Our Environment
* Linux (Tested on Ubuntu 24.04)
* NVIDIA GPU (Tested on Nvidia GeForce RTX A6000)
* Python (3.12.6), PyTorch (version 2.0.0), Lifelines (version 0.27.8), NumPy (version 1.24.1),MONAI (version 1.3), Pandas (version 2.1.2), Albumentations (version 1.3.1), OpenCV (version 4.8.1), Pillow (version 9.3.0), OpenSlide (version 1.1.2), Captum (version 0.6.0), SciPy (version 1.11.3), Seaborn (version 0.13.0), Matplotlib (version 3.8.1), torch_geometric (version 2.4.0), torch-scatter (version 2.1.2), torch-sparse (version 0.6.18).
### Environment Configuration
1. Create a virtual environment and install PyTorch. In the 3rd step, please select the correct Pytorch version that matches your CUDA version from [https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/).
   ```
   $ conda create -n env python=3.12.6
   $ conda activate env
   $ pip install torch
   ```
      *Note:  `pip install` command is required for Pytorch installation.*
   
2. To try out the Python code and set up environment, please activate the `env` environment first:

   ``` shell
   $ conda activate env
   ```
3. For ease of use, you can just set up the environment and run the following:
   ``` shell
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Preparation

### Data Format
* WSIs and clinical information of patients are used in this project. Raw WSIs are stored as ```.svs```, ```.mrxs``` or ```.tiff``` files. Clinical information are stored as ```.csv``` files. 

### Generate Macro npy file

* WSIs are first processed by BlaPaSeg network to get multi-class tissue probability heatmaps , which sorted as ```.npy``` files.
  The macro mode of WSIs can be by generated by calling:

    ``` shell
    $ cd ./Data_process
    $ python BlaPaSeg_inference.py
    ```
* To cut the empty area of macro mode and get square input for training, call:
    ``` shell
    $ cd ./Data_process
    $ python cut_heatmap.py
    ```

### Generate Micro pt file

* Tumor patch feature files are extracted based on Macro npy file and WSIs
  The Tumor patch feature of WSIs can be by generated by calling:

    ``` shell
    $ cd ./Feature_extractor
    $ python inference_ctan.py   #get CTransPath feature
    $ python inference_giga.py   #get Prov-Gigapath feature
    $ python inference_uni.py    #get Uni feature
    $ python inference_virchow.py  #get Virchow feature
    
    ```
  
### Training Scripts

```shell
$ cd ./Training Scripts
$ python train_macro_cash.py   # MacroVisionNet training scripts 
$ python train_uni_cash.py   # UniVisionNet training scripts 
```

### Data Distribution

DATA_ROOT is the base directory of all datasets (e.g. the directory to your SSD or HDD). DATASET is the name of the folder containing data specific to one experiment.
